Simple soundboard app for windows and linux

How it works
===============

You can use this application to bind various sounds to your keyboard and play them
with it, for example while you are in game etc, to entertain others.

This program doesn't work for this purpose itself, you also need to install
virtual sound cable, you can get one
free here: http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/index.htm

How to set things up
======================

Install the virtual cable 2 new devices will appear in your sound
control panels. One is used as a playback device, which is directly
connected into the recording device. That means everything you play
using that device will be streamed into that virtual microphone.

Set that virtual cable as a default recording device.

Now run swaggboard and open preferences, there you should check the
virtual cable as output device as well as your regular speakers
so that you can hear what you play. Put some sounds in there and try
to play them. They will be streamed out using virtual cable input
so that when you open some program that is recording sounds (team speak,
game, etc) everyone there should hear sounds that you are playing
through swaggboard.

That's all folks
